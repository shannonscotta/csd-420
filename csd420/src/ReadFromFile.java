/* Write a test program that reads words from a text file and displays all non-duplicate words in ascending order and then in descending order.
        The file is to be referenced in the program, not needing to be used as a command line reference.
        The word file is to be titled collection_of_words.txt and included in your submission.
        Write test code that ensures the code functions correctly. */
